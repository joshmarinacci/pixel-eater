Eat All The Pixels with this web-based pixel art editor. Try it out at [https://apps.josh.earth/pixel-eater/](https://apps.josh.earth/pixel-eater/)

There is a generic document server for saving and loading, though it currently is broken.
All drawing is done in the browser. The entire UI is in React with custom components.
The UI supports layers and different cursor
tools (eyedropper, pencil, eraser, move, fill, etc.)

Contributions are super welcome. This is your editor as much as mine.

# Build Instructions

It's a standard [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) application. Build with `npm run build`. Open the editor with the file `dist/index.html` in your browser.
